title: Set up a Jekyll website
---

Recently I've thought that having no website is unacceptable for a proficient web developer.

While I'm going to create some demos to showcase my skills later, this is the first step.

I think, having a Jekyll-based blog on GitHub is one of the most geeky ways to create a site for a developer. However, I was lazy enough to set up Ruby locally. It appeared there is a template site called [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/about/) which allows to setup a Jekyll site on GitHub without a local development copy.
