title: Windows Run as Administrator
---

It would be funny how many things in Windows UI are hidden if it wouldn't require googling to find them. And if you don't use a feature often enough you need to search every time as it's forgotten by that time.

One of those memos is: how to run a command as Administrator. Here it is: `Windows+R`, type a command, `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`.

How could I guess this `Ctrl+Shift+`?
